@ Lines starting with @ are comments
@ Columns:
@  Ch            - channel number
@  Width         - ingore, set to 1.0
@  Crosssection  - ignore, set to 1.0
@  Reaction      - channel reaction

@ when first number is divisible by 3 (0*, 3*, 6* etc.) the channel describe background for Lambda(1520) diLepton decay
@ when first number is even (2*, 4*, 6* etc.) the channel describe background for cascade production
@ when firs number is divisible by 2 and 3 (0*,6*), channel belongs to both simulations

@Following channels have been simulated:

@Ch     Width	Crossection	Reaction

002	1.0	1.0		Sigma+(1385)K0p
